
3x3 matrix window:
- smaller than line's thickness (line's thickness is 4 pixel) so it cant capture full segment or point pieces
- because the size is smaller, the pattern look inconsistent

5x5 matrix window:
- the size is big and large enough to capture the segment pieces
- the patterns are more consistent than the 3x3 size
